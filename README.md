# GPT-4 Playground

This project is a playground for [GPT-4](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/), a large-scale unsupervised language model. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

This project allows you to use your API key in a mock ChatGPT environment...this is especially useful for testing out your GPT-4 API key! Additionally, there is a playground environment that allows you to test out your API key with a variety of parameters including increasing your token limit to 31,768 (if you have gotten off of the waitlist).

All API keys are stored in your browser's local storage, so you can use this project without having to worry about your API key being stolen.
